    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <hr>
    <h4>For the slow-cooker roasted broth</h4>
    <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Heat oven to 400F. On a large baking sheet, put 1 1/2 pounds wings and bones in an uncrowded layer. Roast, turning once or twice, until golden brown on all sides, about 45 minutes.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Meanwhile, if using the kombu, in a large saucepan, heat 10 cups of water and the kombu to a boil. Simmer about 10 minutes. Then let steep while the bones finish browning. Use tongs to remove and discard the kombu.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>In a large (4-quart) slow cooker, transfer the bones with all their pan drippings. Add kombu water (or 10 cups fresh water if not using the kombu) and the remaining ingredients. Cover and slow-cook on low, 8 hours.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Strain broth into a container. Refrigerate covered up to 1 week. Freeze up to several months.</p>
    <hr>
    <h4>For grilled-chicken-ramen</h4>
    <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>In a small saucepan, heat 4 cups broth until hot. Season to taste with 2 tablespoons miso, 2 tablespoons soy sauce and 3 tablespoons chili paste. The broth should be highly seasoned. Add mushrooms and simmer over low heat.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Have all the remaining ingredients ready and near the cooking surface. Fill 2 deep soup bowls with very hot water to heat the bowls.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Meanwhile, for noodles, heat a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop noodles into the water; cook, stirring, until al dente (tender but still a bit firm in the center), about 3 minutes. Use tongs or a slotted wire basket to remove noodles to a plate. Save the cooking water for later.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Step 4: </strong>When ready to serve, bring the noodle cooking water to a boil again and dunk the noodles back in to reheat for about 20 seconds. Dump the hot water out of the soup bowls. Divide the hot noodles between the heated bowls. Top each with half of the sliced chicken, egg, radish, bamboo shoots, green onions and bean sprouts. Gently ladle hot broth over all. Sprinkle with cilantro. Serve right away. Pass the pepper blend at the table.</p>
